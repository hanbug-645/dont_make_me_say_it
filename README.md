## Game Rules

- You choose a secret word that Zippy must avoid saying
- Each round, you ask Zippy a question trying to trick it into saying the word
- Zippy will respond while trying to avoid using your secret word
- If Zippy says the exact word (not as part of another word), you win
- If Zippy avoids saying the word for 10 rounds, Zippy wins
- Zippy will concede if your questions narrow down to where only the secret word fits

## Example Gameplay

Secret Word: Apple

User: What fruit is sweet and can be made into cider?
Zippy: Pear. Pears are sweet fruits that can be made into cider, known as "perry".

User: The fruit is also the name of a tech company.
Zippy: Orange. Orange is both a sweet fruit that can be made into cider and was also the name of a cellphone network company.

User: The word starts with an A.
Zippy: Alright, you winâ€”it's apple! I've been cornered here, as you've narrowed it down to a fruit that starts with "A," can be made into cider, and is the name of a tech company. Well played!
